# KOSS_Task_Calculator
This is the calculator made for KOSS Membership.
I have used the PySide package which is a Qt framework for Python, to implement this.
The source code of the calculator can be found in the UICalc folder.
Some screenshots have also been added.
For Windows users , here is the google drive link from where you can download the executabl file(.exe).
[Calculator.exe](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B88vkbpplS96WlYtaGFqNjR6TFU/view?usp=sharing)
Just download and install it !!

Guidelines for using the calculator::
* Only radians can be used in calculations !
* Multiplication is not implicit, i.e. if a=2 then 2a is invalid , you must explicitly write 2*a
* Make sure to give brackets around the functions like sin, cos. e.g sin(2) not sin2 !!

Feel free to contribute to this and point out the issues :)
